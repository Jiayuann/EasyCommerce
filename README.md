#EasyCommerce

### Preface

Easy Commerce is a team of  6 students currently enrolled in CMPS183 a Web Applications class. This class is an introduction
to the design of Web Apps.

### Motivation

We are developing this website because we are looking for a software solution for food shops on our campus. As a student our time is limited, we can not afford to wait in line to purchase goods. We want to build a web app that allows business to create a storefront that displays their menu and allows the customer to place orders online. The web app will notify both customer and vendor about ongoing transaction accordingly. 

### Features
 * Allow vendor to add items.
 * Notified vendor of incoming orders.
 * Process online payments.
 * Vendor can set time for order completion.
 * Customer can track orders status.
